# mobius-networks

Mobius transformation, in higher dimensions, has the form of $f(x) = b + \frac{\alpha A(x-a)}{|x-a|^{\epsilon}}$ where $a,b$ are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\alpha$ is a scalar, $A$ is a rotation matrix and $\epsilon$ is either $0$ or $2$.

This repository deals with the implementation of a layer which performs the above mentioned Mobius tranformation of the input vector.
